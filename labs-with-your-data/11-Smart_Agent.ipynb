    "- **Notebook 01**: We loaded the Azure Search Engine with enriched PDFs in index: \"cogsrch-index-files\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 02**: We loaded more information to the Search Engine this time using a CSV file with 90k rows/articles in index: \"cogsrch-index-csv\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We manually loaded an index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools and built the first Skill/Agent, that can do RAG over a search engine\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We build a second Agent (Pandas) in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We used another  Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 10**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

    "We are missing one more thing: **How do we glue all these features together into a very smart GPT Smart Search Engine Chat Bot?**\n",

    "We want a virtual assistant for our company that can get the question, think what tool to use, then get the answer. The goal is that, regardless of the source of the information (Search Engine, Bing Search, SQL Database, CSV File, JSON File, APIs, etc), the Assistant can answer the question correctly using the right tool.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) understands the question, interacts with the user \n",
    "2) talks to other specialized Agents that are connected to diferent sources\n",

       "\n",
       "COVID-19 has been shown to have a more severe impact on obese individuals, leading to more serious symptoms and a negative prognosis. Here are some key findings related to the impact of COVID-19 on obese individuals:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Increased Risk of Severe Disease**: Obese patients have been found to have increased odds of progressing to severe COVID-19. A study in China found that obese patients had a 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease compared to normal weight patients. Additionally, men who were obese had increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 compared to those who were normal weight [[1]](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0576).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Symptoms and Complications**: Obese patients tend to have symptoms such as cough and fever, and they are at a higher risk of exacerbations from viral respiratory infections. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is significantly associated with obesity, indicating a greater impact on seriously ill COVID-19 patients who are overweight or obese [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22844).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Risk Factor for Serious Illness**: The World Health Organization (WHO) considers obesity a major risk factor for becoming seriously ill with COVID-19. Data from the UK Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre indicates that two-thirds of people who developed serious or fatal COVID-19-related complications were overweight or obese [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22844).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Pathogenesis and Mechanisms**: Obesity plays a significant part in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients, and the role of Body Mass Index (BMI) in the severity of COVID-19 should not be ignored. The consequences of inflammation of adipose tissue have been reported as a leading cause of insulin resistance and hypertension due to metabolic dysfunction. BMI plays a significant role in COVID-19 severity, especially in the elderly population [[4]](http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20098806v1?rss=1).\n",
       "\n",
       "### How COVID-19 Affects Elderly People\n",
       "\n",
       "Elderly individuals are at a higher risk of more serious and possibly fatal illness associated with COVID-19. Here are some key findings related to the impact of COVID-19 on elderly individuals:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Incidence and Severity**: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) is affecting elderly people worldwide with greater incidence and severity. In Spain, 68% of all coronavirus hospitalizations correspond to those over 60 years of age. Mortality data indicates a risk of mortality of 3.6% for people in their 60s, which increases to 8.0% and 14.8% for people in their 70s and over 80s [[5]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.004).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Social Isolation and Health Measures**: Global recommendations for older populations include social isolation, hygiene, and social distancing measures to reduce the transmission of the virus. Biopsychosocial care of elderly people, adapting care and personalizing decisions on hospital admissions, palliative care, and alternatives for monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 pathology are essential [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.004).\n",

       "The \"Kidney Heist\" legend is a well-known urban legend that has circulated widely over the past fifteen years. This legend typically involves a core set of three elements: a drugged drink, an ice-filled bathtub, and the punch line of kidney theft. There are numerous versions of this legend, each with its own specific details, but the core elements remain consistent across the variations. One version, for example, features a married man who receives a drugged drink from a prostitute he has invited to his room in Las Vegas, creating a morality play with kidneys.\n",
       "\n",
       "This legend is an example of a story that sticks in people's minds. It is memorable, understandable, and effective in changing thought or behavior. The story is characterized by vivid, concrete details, such as the ice-filled bathtub and the weird tube protruding from the lower back, which evoke fear, disgust, and suspicion. These concrete details make the story more tangible and believable, contributing to its memorability and retellability.\n",
       "\n",
       "The \"Kidney Heist\" legend is an example of how localized details lend credibility to stories. Folk legends, including urban legends, often acquire credibility and effect from their localized details, making them more memorable and believable.

       "The legend of the \"Kidney Heist\" is just one example of a sticky idea, and it demonstrates the power of stories in shaping perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors.

       "The NP-complete problem is a class of problems that are both in NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) and NP-hard. These problems are known to be in NP but are not known to be in P (deterministic polynomial time). The hypothesis that P is not equal to NP is strongly supported by the existence of many practical and theoretical problems that are in class NP but for which deterministic polynomial-time solutions are not known. These problems are referred to as NP-complete problems, and they are the hardest among all problems that are in NP.\n",

       "To prove that a given problem L is NP-hard, it is sufficient to show that another problem that is known to be NP-complete is polynomial-time reducible to L. This is done by providing a polynomial-time reduction from the NP-complete problem to problem L. Such a reduction shows how every instance of the NP-complete problem can be transformed into an instance of problem L. The reducibility relation between problems is a transitive relation.\n",

       "The NP-complete \"club\" consists of problems that are polynomial-time reducible to each other. This makes the NP-complete problems an interesting class of problems: either all of them can be solved in deterministic polynomial time or none will ever be. Discovering one NP-complete problem that has a deterministic polynomial-time solution also implies that P = NP. Currently, there are many problems that are known to be NP-complete, but none has been solvable in deterministic polynomial time yet. The efforts put into the study of these problems in order to solve them in deterministic polynomial time have been immense but without success. This is the main evidence strengthening the hypothesis that P ≠ NP and that NP-complete problems are also intractable.\n",

Despite its seemingly simple description, finding the optimal solution to the TSP becomes increasingly difficult as the number of cities increases. The number of possible routes grows factorially with the number of cities, making it computationally infeasible to solve for large instances using brute-force methods.\n",

       "The document \"Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life\" by Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend provides valuable insights into setting boundaries with children. Here are some key points to consider when setting boundaries with kids:\n",
       "\n",
       "### Developmental Aspect of Boundaries\n",
       "- **Bonding and Boundaries**: Secure bonding is essential before children can effectively learn and set boundaries. It allows them to gain independence without fear.\n",
       "- **Abandonment Fears**: Children lacking secure bonding may find setting boundaries frightening and may fear abandonment.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Teaching Boundaries to Children\n",
       "- **Instilling vs. Repairing Boundaries**: Teaching responsibility, limit setting, and delay of gratification early on can make later years smoother. It's important to start early, but even parents of older children can work on boundary development with more support and effort.\n",
       "- **Boundary Development**: Teaching responsibility and autonomy is crucial. This involves both positive and negative aspects of discipline.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Role of Boundaries in Child Rearing\n",
       "- **Self-Protection**: Boundaries are designed to keep the good in and the bad out, serving as a way for children to protect and safeguard their well-being.\n",
       "- **Learning to Accept Limits**: Children need to learn to accept the limits of others, which helps them mature and deepen their love for others.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Internalizing Boundaries\n",
       "- **Internal Sense of Motivation**: The goal of boundaries is to develop an internal sense of motivation with self-induced consequences. Successful parenting means that children want to be responsible, empathic, and caring because it's important to them.\n",
       "\n",
       "These insights emphasize the importance of secure bonding, responsibility, and self-protection in the growth and well-being of children.
