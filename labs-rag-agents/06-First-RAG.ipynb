Simple example: an Agent might not have the inherent capability to reliably perform mathematical calculations by itself. However, we can introduce an expert - in this case a calculator, an expert at mathematical calculations. Now, when we need to perform a calculation, the Agent can call in the expert rather than trying to predict the result itself.

       "### What are Markov Chains?\n",
       "\n",
       "A Markov chain is a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another within a finite or countable number of possible states. It is a stochastic process characterized by the \"memoryless\" property, which means that the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. This property is known as the Markov property.\n",
       "\n",
       "Markov chains can be described by:\n",
       "1. **States**: The different possible conditions or positions in which the system can be.\n",
       "2. **Transition Probabilities**: The probabilities of moving from one state to another.\n",
       "3. **Initial State**: The state in which the system starts.\n",
       "\n",
       "The process is typically represented using a state transition matrix, where each element indicates the probability of transitioning from one state to another.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Applications of Markov Chains in Medicine\n",
       "\n",
       "Markov chains have several applications in the field of medicine, ranging from disease modeling to treatment planning. Here are some notable examples:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Phylogenetic Analysis**:\n",
       "   - Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to improve the resolution of phylogenies for rapidly evolving pathogens. This approach helps in joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny, taking into account the ensemble of near-optimal alignments to avoid biases [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1853084/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacupiytfx&se=2025-01-30T14:55:42Z&st=2024-07-10T06:55:42Z&spr=https&sig=NQgAnpUqrSUPKdOZwtvdSQP2pjwoeUK0xlNtd%2F554t8%3D).\n",

       "   - Markov processes are used in stochastic models to predict the spread of diseases, such as in the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model. This approach helps in improved time series prediction of the number of infectious cases, which is crucial for managing public health responses [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2780467/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacupiytfx&se=2025-01-30T14:55:42Z&st=2024-07-10T06:55:42Z&spr=https&sig=NQgAnpUqrSUPKdOZwtvdSQP2pjwoeUK0xlNtd%2F554t8%3D).\n",

       "1. **Human Contact Networks**:\n",
       "    - The dynamics of infectious diseases that spread via direct person-to-person transmission (e.g., influenza, smallpox, HIV/AIDS) are heavily influenced by the structure of human contact networks. These networks often exhibit strong community structures, which can significantly impact disease dynamics. Effective immunization strategies often target individuals who bridge different communities rather than just highly connected individuals [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851561/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacupiytfx&se=2025-01-30T14:55:42Z&st=2024-07-10T06:55:42Z&spr=https&sig=NQgAnpUqrSUPKdOZwtvdSQP2pjwoeUK0xlNtd%2F554t8%3D).\n",

      "\n",
      "Human contact networks play a crucial role in the spread of infectious diseases that are transmitted through direct person-to-person contact, such as influenza, smallpox, and HIV/AIDS. These networks often exhibit strong community structures, which significantly impact disease dynamics. Key insights include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Community Structure**:\n",
      "   - Strong community structures influence the spread of diseases within and between communities. Immunization strategies targeting individuals who bridge different communities are more effective than those targeting highly connected individuals within the same community. This is because these \"bridge\" individuals facilitate the spread of the disease across different communities [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851561/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacupiytfx&se=2025-01-30T14:55:42Z&st=2024-07-10T06:55:42Z&spr=https&sig=NQgAnpUqrSUPKdOZwtvdSQP2pjwoeUK0xlNtd%2F554t8%3D).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Network Reshaping**:\n",
      "   - The reshaping of contact networks based on individuals' health status can significantly hinder disease progression. For example, healthy individuals avoiding contact with infected individuals can reduce the average time required to eradicate a disease or delay its spread to the entire population [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924249/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacupiytfx&se=2025-01-30T14:55:42Z&st=2024-07-10T06:55:42Z&spr=https&sig=NQgAnpUqrSUPKdOZwtvdSQP2pjwoeUK0xlNtd%2F554t8%3D).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mixing Patterns**:\n",
      "   - Different mixing patterns (assortative vs. disassortative) affect epidemic dynamics and the efficacy of control measures like contact tracing. Assortative mixing (nodes with similar numbers of contacts) leads to faster epidemic growth but makes contact tracing more effective for large epidemics. Conversely, disassortative mixing (nodes with different numbers of contacts) slows initial epidemic growth but can make contact tracing less effective [[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2386895/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacupiytfx&se=2025-01-30T14:55:42Z&st=2024-07-10T06:55:42Z&spr=https&sig=NQgAnpUqrSUPKdOZwtvdSQP2pjwoeUK0xlNtd%2F554t8%3D).\n",

Probabilistic methods accounting for sampling bias can improve the resolution of observed transmission patterns, helping to identify regions like East-Southeast Asia as sources of new seasonal variants.
