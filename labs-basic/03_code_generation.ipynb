This effectively links each employee to their respective department.\n",

      "   - The main query then filters the joined `Department` and `Employee` records to include only those employees whose `id` is in the list of `employee_id` values returned by the subquery. This means we are only considering employees who have received salary payments in the last 3 months.\n",
      "\n",
